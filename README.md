### 🧠 Inspired By

- **The UNIX Philosophy** — modularity, text-first, composability  
- **Suckless** design — minimal, extensible, (trying to) no bloat  
- **Greek Mythology** — Ananke, the force of inevitability and necessity  
- **CLI Life** — Tools like `neomutt`, `pass`, `notmuch`, `vdirsyncer`, `abook`, `mbsync`, and `khal`  
- **Offline computing** — Privacy and permanence over SaaS dependence

### 🚀 Goal

> To create a fully terminal-based, encrypted, tag-driven email system that feels like second nature — deterministic, beautiful, and local-first.
