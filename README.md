# ⛩️ ANANKE — The Inevitable Mail System

*Ananke (pronounced ah-NAHN-kee) is the ancient Greek personification of inevitability, compulsion, and necessity. In mythology, she represents the inescapable force that governs fate and the natural order of the cosmos—things that must happen and cannot be avoided.*

> Secure, offline-first, tag-centric email forged by necessity.

### 🧠 Inspired By

- **The UNIX Philosophy** — modularity, text-first, composability  
- **Suckless** design — minimal, extensible, (trying to) no bloat  
- **Greek Mythology** — Ananke, the force of inevitability and necessity  
- **CLI Life** — Tools like `neomutt`, `pass`, `notmuch`, `vdirsyncer`, `abook`, `mbsync`, and `khal`  
- **Offline computing** — Privacy and permanence over SaaS dependence

### 🚀 Goal

> To create a fully terminal-based, encrypted, tag-driven email system that feels like second nature — deterministic, beautiful, and local-first.
